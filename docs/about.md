#We like to experiment, learn, and create.

DEVICEFACTORY is founded by a team of people that relate to each other through technology. We are enthusiastic about the generation of new ideas while exploring problems, and the conversion of these ideas into physical solutions.

Our experience is in software and hardware development, product design, quantitative analysis, and problem solving. Our abilities allow us to create dynamic systems that go beyond what a software only solution can provide.

Execution matters. Dedication and perseverance are required to work though all the stages of design and development in making a finished product.  Our goal is to deliver adaptable platforms to those with a desire to learn, as well as foster a community capable of deploying devices as a solution to a challenge.

DEVICEFACTORY is constructed as a virtual company: there is no factory or officeâ€¦ you will find us on the internet, in cafes, and in bars.

We hope you will join us on our GitHub and on the Forums!
